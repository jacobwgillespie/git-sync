# git-sync

A small CLI that implements the functionality of [`hub sync`](https://github.com/github/hub). Run `git-sync` to fast-forward outdated branches and remove merged and deleted upstream branches.

### Why

`hub` is deprecated by the [`gh` CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli), and I haven't found an alternative script that performs the same actions as `hub sync`.

## Installation

Either download from the [project releases](https://github.com/jacobwgillespie/git-sync/releases), or install with Homebrew:

```shell
$ brew install jacobwgillespie/tap/git-sync
```

## Usage

Run either `git-sync` or `git sync`.
